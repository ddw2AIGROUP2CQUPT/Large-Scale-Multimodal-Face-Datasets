**FaceCaption-15M, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset of facial images accompanied by their natural language descriptions (facial image-to-text). This dataset aims to facilitate a study on face-centered tasks. FaceCaption-15M comprises over 15 million pairs of facial images and their corresponding natural language descriptions of facial features, making it the largest facial image caption dataset to date.**  
**[24/09/01] The embeddings of images in FaceCaption-15M has been released! [OpenFace-CQUPT/Facecaption-15M-Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenFace-CQUPT/Facecaption-15M-Embeddings)**

**HumanCaption-10M: a large, diverse, high-quality dataset of human-related images with natural language descriptions (image to text). The dataset is designed to facilitate research on human-centered tasks. HumanCaption-10M contains approximately 10 million human-related images and their corresponding facial features in natural language descriptions and is the second generation version of FaceCaption-15M**

**Approximately 311,000 human-related images and their corresponding natural language descriptions.
Compared to [HumanCaption-10M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenFace-CQUPT/HumanCaption-10M), this dataset not only includes associated facial language descriptions but also filters out images with higher resolution and employs the powerful visual understanding capabilities of GPT-4V to generate more detailed and accurate text descriptions.
This dataset is used for the second phase of training [HumanVLM](https://huggingface.co/OpenFace-CQUPT/Human_LLaVA), enhancing the model's capabilities in caption generation and visual understanding.**
